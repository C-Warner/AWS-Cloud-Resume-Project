      <p>Hello there! I'm Charlie Warner, a data analyst with a knack for crunching numbers and uncovering the narratives hidden within them. While data analysis is my profession, my main passion lies in cybersecurity and programming. I view web development as a fun hobby; this very website is a testament to that. It's hosted in the cloud, specifically on AWS, which was a deliberate choice to immerse myself in cloud services and web development. However, my focus isn't solely on building websites. I'm driven by a desire to learn a bit of everything, especially skills that make a well-rounded security analyst. This site is more than just a display of my current abilities; it reflects my journey through the dynamic and ever-expanding world of technology. Eager to learn, adapt, and grow, I dive into diverse areas like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, all with an eye towards enhancing my cybersecurity expertise.<br>
      <u> **TL;DR: Charlie Warner here, data analyst and cybersecurity enthusiast. This website, a fun dive into web development and AWS, is part of my journey to master diverse tech skills for a career in cybersecurity** </u></p>
